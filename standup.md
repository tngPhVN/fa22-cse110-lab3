1.What did I work on before today?
* I started on working Lab 3 on Thursday Oct 13 and implementing Part 2 CSS file locally. Wrote down Issues might have on paper. 

2.What am I working on today?
* Finish up Part 2.
* Create Issues accordingly on Github. 
* Create Pull Requests associating with Issues from branch lab3-update to main branch. 
* Merge Pull Requests to main. 

3.What issues did block me?
* While I was implementing the CSS file, the Flex and Grid layout required me to read the provided document carefully since it was quite confusing. 
* Instead of creating pull request for each new commit, I mistakenly created only one pull request for some update commits that I made prior.
